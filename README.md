# HauteLook React Test

Instructions for the HauteLook Web Engineer React Test

## Requirements

   * node - `0.12.7` or higher
   * npm - `2.12.1` or higher

## Installation

   * Make sure you have a working internet connection. You will need npm to download dependencies.
   * Install dependencies using `npm install`

Note: We expect installation to take less than 5 minutes to setup. If for any reason it is taking longer, please feel free to reach out to us. We are happy to [help](#support).

## Running The Server

After installation, start the node server by running: `npm start`

The server should start on port 3000 without errors. If port 3000 is already taken, you can set a custom port: `PORT=3001 npm start`

You should be able to see the index page with some basic html output. This also means React is working within the browser.

## Code Layout

Here is a high level overview of the important files in this project:

   * `server.js` - The express server
   * `public/index.html` - The page to display all the events
   * `public/design.html` - Design comp information

## Challenge

Use the production HauteLook Events API to list all the events in a grid format. Go to the index web page for detailed instructions. You are free to use whatever JS/CSS packages, libraries, tools and frameworks to complete the task. However, you must use React to render the markup into the DOM. You will be judged on the quality of code, the use of React and the look of the webpage. You do not need to minify or compress the JS or CSS. However, you are encouraged to organize your JS and CSS in a way you think is best for someone to review the code.
